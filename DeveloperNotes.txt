Well if you've got this far you've at least found the development version of HTML_AJAX
If you want to run a non released version you have to perform some of the magic the pear
installer does on your own.

The quickest solution to this is to run pear install -f package.xml.  
This will install HTML_AJAX overwriting whatever version is currently installed.
If your on windows you'll want to take a look at test.bat.

Or you can simply check out HTML_AJAX into a directory called HTML and set the parent
directory in an .htacess file as the include path, also make sure you turn off E_STRICT
or the examples will break

php_value include_path "/path/to/HTML/parent"
